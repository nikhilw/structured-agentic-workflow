# Test Scope

This file holds two definitions the rest of the workflow depends on and must never restate:

1. **The ladder**, how wide a test run has to be at the gate you are standing in.
2. **The citable-run rule**, when a run already made can stand in for a run now required.

Neither is a step. Reading this satisfies no gate; it only tells you which run satisfies the gate you are already in.

## Why this exists

Each gate used to demand the full suite independently, because no gate could see any other gate's runs. A three-phase plan paid for six or seven full-suite runs, most of them re-proving code untouched since the previous one. The ladder gives a gate a vocabulary narrower than "everything". The citable-run rule lets the last gates share one run instead of duplicating it.

Neither is permission to prove less. Both are accounting, and the accounting is the price: a narrow run is only acceptable because it is **recorded as narrow** and stays visible to every later reader.

## The ladder

The plan carries the actual commands in its **Test Commands** block. This file carries only the rungs.

| Rung | Scope | Typical shape |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 focused** | The tests for the change in front of you | The phase's own test criteria; the single test you just wrote |
| **T2 impacted** | Every test a change-aware selector says this change can reach | `pytest --testmon`, `jest --changedSince`, `vitest related`, `cargo test -p`, `go test` on the touched package |
| **T3 segment** | The full suite for the one segment that changed, plus **that segment's** static gates | Backend suite + its type checker; frontend suite + its type checker and linter |
| **T4 full** | The whole suite, every segment, every static gate | What the project runs in CI |

**T2 before T3.** A change-aware selector proves more than a segment suite and costs less, because it selects across the whole repo by actual dependency rather than by directory. Use T3 only when the plan lists no T2 tool for this project.

**A segment owns its own static gates.** A type checker, linter, or formatter runs because *its* language changed, never because a sibling segment changed. A UI-only change runs the frontend suite and the frontend type check. It does not run the Python suite and it does not run mypy. That is the single most common wasted run in this workflow.

### The one-minute rule

**If T4 costs under a minute, there is no ladder.** Run T4 at every gate and say once that you are doing so. The ladder buys back minutes; below that threshold it costs more in judgment than it saves in wall time. The plan's Test Commands block records T4's measured time. Without a plan, use what T4 actually took the first time you ran it.

### Escalation triggers

Scoped runs are the default, and **any one of these voids the default for that run**. Go to T4:

- A dependency manifest or lockfile changed.
- Build, packaging, or tooling config changed: the project file, the type-checker or bundler config, CI config, a Makefile or task runner.
- A shared, base, or cross-cutting module changed, or anything imported from more than one segment.
- A public interface, signature, or return type changed and it has callers outside the changed segment.
- A migration, schema, fixture factory, or shared test helper changed.
- A generated or vendored artifact changed, or an input a generator reads.
- The selector's own state is stale or absent: a fresh clone, a cleared cache, a `--testmon` database from before a rebase. Run T4 once to re-seed, then go back down.
- **You cannot tell which segment the change is in.** Uncertainty is an escalation trigger, not a reason to guess narrow.

### When there is no plan

Bug fixes and quick fixes skip planning, so nothing hands you a Test Commands block. Detect segments before you run anything:

1. Look for separate manifests at distinct roots, workspace or monorepo config, or conventional directories (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `api/`, `web/`, `packages/*`, `apps/*`).
2. Map each segment to its own test command and its own static gates.
3. If detection is ambiguous, that is the last escalation trigger above. Run T4.

Then: scoped while fixing, T4 once at the completion claim.

## Rung by gate

This table is the only place rung assignments are written down. A skill that runs tests names its row here and does not repeat the rung.

| Gate | Rung | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/build-phase` Step 3, per phase | T1, then T2 (T3 if the plan lists no T2) | The common case, and the one that used to run T4 once per phase |
| `/build-phase` Phase Completion | **T4, always** | The builder's own honesty gate. Never cited from anywhere. This is the run the handoff reports |
| `/3p-review` re-deriving the builder's claims | **T4, always** | The builder's reported run is a claim, never a citable run. Holds even when you built this yourself minutes ago and the tree is provably clean: re-deriving is the whole reason the review is worth running |
| `/3p-review` while fixing findings inside a round | T1, then T2 or T3 | The "widening circles" |
| `/3p-review` sign-off | T4, or cite this review's own T4 when nothing changed since | |
| `/verification-before-completion` | T4, or cite `/3p-review`'s sign-off run | The plan-requirements checklist is not a test run and is never cited. It always runs fresh |
| Bug or quick-fix path, no plan | T2 or T3 by segment detection, then T4 at the completion claim | |

Two full-suite runs per feature are mandatory and cannot be traded away: the builder's at Phase Completion, and the reviewer's first-party one. Everything else is either scoped or cited.

## The citable-run rule

A run already recorded satisfies a run now required **only when all four hold**:

1. **You made it, in this session, with your own hands.** A run reported to you in a handoff summary, a build completion report, or any other model's summary is a claim, not a run. Re-run it. This is what keeps `/3p-review` independent of the builder, and it holds even when the builder and the reviewer are the same model wearing a different persona.
2. **Same command, same rung.** A T2 run does not satisfy a T4 requirement because it passed. Never describe a narrow run in wide words.
3. **Same tree.** `git status --porcelain` and `git diff` show zero changes since the run, untracked files included. One comment, one formatting pass, one file you touched and reverted by hand, all void it. Re-run.
4. **You write the citation down.** Name the run you are citing and state what proved the tree unchanged. An unstated citation is indistinguishable from a skipped gate, and will be read as one.

Fail any condition and there is no citation, only a run you still owe.

**A row marked "always" in the table above takes no citation, under any conditions.** Those two runs are not redundancy to be optimized away; they are the only two points where the suite is proven against a tree nobody is still editing. A single session that both builds and reviews (the `/build-model` path) owns both of them and pays for both. Condition 1 would let that session cite itself, which is exactly why the table overrides it.

## Recording

**Every run is recorded with its rung.** "T2 impacted, exit 0, 34 passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped", never "tests pass".

The rung travels with the run through every artifact that carries it: the build completion report, the handoff summary's Verification Runs, the review ledger, the sign-off. A reader who cannot see the rung cannot tell the difference between a criterion proven against the whole suite and one proven against four files, and will assume the first.

**A criterion proven only at T1 or T2 is a ledger row, not a green check.** It is disposed of the same way a manual criterion is: proven at a wider rung, or risk-accepted in writing by the human.

**Widening the label is the failure mode that makes this whole mechanism unsafe.** Calling a T2 run "the full suite" converts an honest saving into a false claim, and every gate downstream inherits it. If you are unsure which rung a run was, it was the narrower one.
